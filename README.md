# Flutter Learning Journey

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm starting my Flutter journey with this repository. For now, there isn't much here, but I'll be committing my progress and learning notes as I go.

## What to Expect

- Regular updates as I learn Flutter.
- Code samples, commits to each code, simple notes.
- Each week will focus on a different topic or concept.

## Week 1: Dart Basics

I'm beginning with the fundamentals of Dart, the programming language used by Flutter. Stay tuned for updates as I share what I learn!
